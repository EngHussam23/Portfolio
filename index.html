            <p class="journey_body">
                I started my journey as a software developer in 2021, and I worked with Flutter for android
                applications. I used to design and build applications by my self and somtimes with a small team consists
                of four developers, we stuggled in designing being conserned about the design we want for the
                application we are building whether it's codable or not. In 2023 I switched to UX/UI Design to sharpen
                my designing and decision making skills towards how to design what, in order to become a good designer
                and developer at the same time and to break the gap between developers and designers too.
