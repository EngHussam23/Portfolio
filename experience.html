            <p class="paragraph_body">
                Throughout my journey in front-end web development, I focused on learning how to design and build the
                visual and interactive aspects of websites. My purpose was to acquire the skills needed to create
                engaging and user-friendly web experiences. Through hands-on projects and coursework, I gained
                proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing me to construct the structure and functionality of
                websites. I encountered challenges in understanding code logic and structure, but these obstacles
                ultimately enhanced my problem-solving abilities.

            <h3 class="paragraph_header">UX/UI Design</h3>
            <p class="paragraph_body">
                Driven by a passion for delivering exceptional user experiences, I embarked on a journey into the realm
                of UX/UI design. This experience allowed me to dive into the user's perspective, analyzing their needs,
                behaviors, and preferences. I learned how to translate research insights into user-centered designs by
                crafting wireframes, creating intuitive user interfaces, and conducting usability tests. The challenge
                in this domain was to shift my mindset towards a user-centered approach, which ultimately refined my
                ability to empathize with users and design interfaces that meet their expectations.
